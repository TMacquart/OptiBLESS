% The output structure can contain any data you whish the code to output.
% Addtionally, if you have constraints to enforce indirectly you must
% somehow relate the number of violated constraints with fitness
% calculations, for instance:
% Fitness =  Fitness * NviolatedConstraints


% ---                   
% output.NViolatedConst = TO COMPLETE HERE      % set to 0 if no constraint is calculated (this field is compulsory) - used during inipop generation 
% output.YourFIELD  =                           % optional output you which to display at the end of the optimisation

% If more input are required (e.g. Input2), you will have to use a wrapper
% function because the default Matlab GA only accepted fitness functions 
% with 1 vector input of design variables. 
% Wrapper function example:
% WrappedFitnessFct = @(A,B,D) UserDefine_ABDFitness(A,B,D,Input2);
