%     Example of user defined function using RMSE_LP as fitness function 
%     Average of the Root Mean Square Error between lamination paramters

% In addition to Fitness, user defined fitness function must also return an
% output structure which must at least contain 1 field corresponding to the
% number of violated constraints (i.e. output.NViolatedConst). This is used
% during initial population generation to check the feasibility of initial
% individuals.
